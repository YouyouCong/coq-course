# Session 5 (Thursday April 6th)

1. ~~Irene Lobo will present something great.~~ Not yet.

2. Discuss exercises from session 4:
   [Exercises](/exercises/4/).
   
   Simon showed how to use Setoid equality so that one can use the usual `reflexivity` and `rewrite`
   tactics on `stream_eq`. See [highlights](https://github.com/dschoepe/coq-course-exercises#week-4).
   
3. [Syllabus](/syllabus.md)

   - We decided to aim towards the [Norm](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/Norm.html) chapter in SF. 
     Of course, speakers are free to pick topics that do not relate to this.

## For next time

- Read the [Types chapter](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/Types.html) and
  do the [Exercises](/exercises/5/ex-types.v).  
  
  You don't need to do the [exercises about Maps](/exercises/5/Maps.v), but you may want to look at [that chapter](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/Maps.html) nonetheless.
